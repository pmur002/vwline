    <p>
    When drawing a line that has a noticable width, the style used to
    draw the ends of the line becomes significant.  
    Graphics formats such as PDF (<a href="#PDF">Adobe Systems Incorporated, 2006</a>), 
    SVG (<a href="#SVG">Ferraiolo and ed., 2001</a>), and PostScript (<a href="#PostScript">Adobe Systems Incorporated, 1999</a>)
    offer three options for the line end style:
    "round", "butt", and "square".  
    The following diagram shows 
    a thick line drawn with each of these line endings in the R
    graphics system.
  </p>


    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/end-styles-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    If the width of the line is allowed to vary along its length, the 
    meaning of these standard line endings becomes more complex; 
    for example, a "round" line ending is no longer a semi-circle and a 
    "square" line ending becomes a trapezoid, as shown below.
  </p>

    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-end-styles-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    Similarly, the corner style becomes significant when drawing
    a series of line segments with a noticeable width, with 
    options usually including "round", "mitre", and "bevel".
  </p>

    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/join-styles-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    Again, if the line width is allowed to vary, the meaning
    of these styles becomes more complex.  For example, 
    a "round" corner is unlikely to be satisfied by an simple
    circular arc.

    This document considers a variety of scenarios for line ends
    and line joins and describes general algorithms that
    can cope coherently and consistently with a wide range of
    possibilities.  The approach described here is implemented
    in the 'vwline' package
    (<a href="#vwline-pkg">Murrell, 2017b</a>, <a href="#vwline-intro">Murrell, 2017a</a>)
  </p>
    <h2>Variable-width line endings</h2>
    <p>
    The simplest scenario to consider is when the width of the line
    is allowed to vary identically on either side of the central line.
    In this case, for a "round" end, although the end is no longer a
    semi-circle, it makes sense to use an appropriate circular arc.
  </p>

    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-arc-end-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    However, in the 'vwline' package for R, 
    some functions allow us 
    to specify a different width to the left and to the right
    of the central line.  Some other functions allow us to specify the 
    width at an angle other than perpendicular to the central line.
    Both of these scenarios mean that the left edge and the right
    edge can approach the end of the line at different angles,
    which means that a circular arc is no longer an appropriate line
    ending.
  </p>

    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-warp-end-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to accomodate these more complex scenarios, we must 
    allow the line end shape to be more flexible than a circular arc.
    The solution adopted in 'vwline' is to draw a single 
    cubic Bezier curve for the line ending.  This curve is tuned
    so that it closely approximates a semicircle when the 
    line edges are parallel (i.e., the line width is constant),
    but generalises to non-circular shapes.  
  </p>
    <p>
    The fundamental idea is to generate a cubic Bezier curve for the
    line ending and this requires 4 control points.  The first and last
    control points are easy - they are the two ends of the left and
    right edges of the variable-width line.  
  </p>
    <p>
    The middle two control points for the Bezier curve are found by
    extending both the left and right edges, which ensures that the line ending
    connects smoothly with the edges 
    (these extensions are represented by green line
    segments on the diagrams below).  
    The amount to extend the edges
    is based on the "angle" of the line ending and the "radius" of the 
    line ending.  
  </p>
    <p>
    The angle and radius of the line ending are determined by 
    generating line segments perpendicular to the edges of the 
    variable-width line and calculating the angle at which those
    line segments intersect and the distances from the edges to
    the point of intersection (this calculation is represented by
    the light green shaded regions on the diagrams below).
  </p>
    <p>
    When the angle is between 0 and 90 degrees, and the edges 
    approach the line ending symmetrically, we get a good 
    approximation of a circular arc using the following formula
    (from <a href="#rivskus">Riškus, 2015</a>):
  </p>
    <pre>
radius*(4/(3*(1/cos(angle/2) + 1))
  </pre>
    <p>
    When the edges approach the line ending asymmetrically, the distances
    from the edges to the intersection are no longer equal and we take
    the smaller of the two. 
  </p>
    <p>
    If the edges of the variable-width 
    line are parallel then the line ending has an angle
    of 180 degrees and the formula breaks down.
    In this case, we extend the edges by 2/3 of the line width
    (following <a href="#slinker">Slinker, 2008</a>).
  </p>
    <p>
    This approach produces reasonable approximations to circular arcs
    for symmetric line endings and reasonable results for asymmetric
    line endings, as shown below. 
    As the angle of the line ending becomes large, 
    the result starts to diverge significantly from a circular arc, but
    this downside is an acceptable price for being able to handle
    asymmetric line endings (and it pays off even more when
    we get to "round" line joins later on).  
  </p>



    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-converge-end-debug-1.svg" width="30%">
      <img src="figure/vw-diverge-end-debug-1.svg" width="30%">
      <img src="figure/vw-asym-end-debug-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    The possibility of edges converging at the end of a line also
    introduces a new "mitre" line end style.  This line ending is
    easy to generate by simply extending the edges of the line
    until they intersect (this is represented by the orange
    lines in the diagrams above).
  </p>

    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-mitre-end-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    A "square" end is easier to deal with, even in complex scenarios.
    We simply place a new line parallel to the line end at a distance
    equal to half of the width of the line at the line end 
    (represented by the pink line on the diagrams above) and then
    intersect the line edges with this parallel line.
    One complication that we must deal with is the possibility that
    the edges intersect with each other before they intersect
    with the parallel line.  Once detected, this can be handled
    easily by simply converting to the "mitre" solution.
    Conversely, a "mitre" end must be converted to a "square" end
    when the edges are parallel or diverging.
  </p>
    <h2>Variable-width line joins</h2>
    <p>
    A "round" line join is handled similarly to a "round" line end,
    with a single cubic Bezier that approximates a circular arc
    when the edge angles either side of the corner are symmetric, but
    adapts to asymmetric situations as well.
  </p>


    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-arc-join-1.svg" width="30%">
      <img src="figure/vw-warp-join-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    The line join can become more complex than a line end because
    it is possible for a corner to "invert" if the line width
    is (dramatically) decreasing as it approaches from both sides
    (see the left image below).
    It is also possible for the corner to require an inflected curve
    if the width is increasing (dramatically) from one side and
    decreasing from the other (or vice versa; see the right image below).
  </p>


    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-invert-join-1.svg" width="30%">
      <img src="figure/vw-inflect-join-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    The algorithm described for "round" line ends comfortably handles the
    case of an inverted join and the case of an inflected join
    is handled as a special case where we
    take the "radius" of the join to be half the distance between
    the ends of the edges.
  </p>


    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-invert-join-debug-1.svg" width="30%">
      <img src="figure/vw-inflect-join-debug-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    Mitre line joins are much easier because they just require 
    extending the edges until they intersect (see the left image below).
    A mitre-limit is
    used to avoid extremely large mitres by converting to a bevel ending.
    The only complication is the case where the line join involves
    an inflection.  In this case, one edge will intersect the "end" of 
    the other line segment before it intersects the other edge, which 
    produces a "dog-leg" mitre join (see the right image below).
  </p>


    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-mitre-join-1.svg" width="30%">
      <img src="figure/vw-mitre-inflect-join-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    Bevel line joins are very simple, because they just require a
    straight line from one edge to the next and this can be 
    achieved in all possible line-join scenarios.
  </p>
    <h3>Inner joins</h3>
    <p>
    Up to this point, we have only had to consider the "outside"
    of a line join (for a right-turn corner, this is the right side of
    the join; for a left-turn corner, this is the left side of the join).
    In most situations, on the "inside" of a corner, the edges 
    that meet at the corner intersect each other, so we can simply use
    that intersection point as the inside of the join.
  </p>
    <p>
    However, in the 'vwline' package, the 
    <code>vwline</code> function also allows the width to be constant
    along a segment and step up instantly at a join.  This does not create
    any new problems for the outside of a join, but it does introduce
    some problems for the inside of a join.
  </p>
    <p>
    One problem is that the inside of a join can have the inflection issue,
    so we need to intersect an edge with the end of the previous or next
    segment of the line (see the left image below).
    The second problem is that it is possible for the inside 
    of one segment of the line
    to extend beyond the <em>outside</em> of another segment
    (see the right image below).
  </p>


    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/vw-inflect-inner-join-1.svg" width="30%">
      <img src="figure/vw-extend-inner-join-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    A single algorithm that can accomodate the normal, simple case
    and these less common ones, is to draw the inside join by a line segment
    from the end of edge <em>i</em> 
    to the centre of the corner, then a line segment
    from the centre of the corner 
    to the start of edge <em>i</em>+1 (see the left image below).  
    This will produce a loop in the boundary
    of the variable-width line in many cases, but that is removed 
    by simplifying the boundary with <code>polysimplify</code> from
    the 'polyclip' package (<a href="#polyclip">Johnson and Baddeley, 2017</a>;  see the right
    image below).
  </p>


    <p class="img">
      <img src="figure/inner-join-alg-1.svg" width="30%">
      <img src="figure/inner-join-simplify-1.svg" width="30%">
    </p>
    <p>
    A known problem with this approach is that it will produce "spikes" 
    on the inside of a join when the width is increasing rapidly towards
    the join, as shown below.  A more pleasing result would be to clip
    those spikes off, but to do so would produce inconsistent results for
    the unusual cases outlined above.  One possibility would be to provide
    a parameter that allows
    the user to specify the behaviour of the algorithm for inside joins.
  </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    join styles.
